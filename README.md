# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- The motivation for this project was to complete the pre work or the Rutgers course, and as a result, have a fully functioning website where I can write my notes throughout the course.
- I built this project to get a better grasp on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in an interative and thought-provoking way.
- This project solves the problem of having lots of different books or folders of notes, and instead, will allow me to know exactly where my revision notes are, so I can access them faster.
- I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with practices like command line usage, project management on Github, and debugging code.

Instructions for use of Prework Study Guide:

The webpage has four seperate parts to it. One for notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and finally JavaScript. Notes are placed under each heading on the page. Notes can include things such as new topics learnt, things you want to remember, and any general thoughts about what you are currently studying. 

The JavaScript can also be seen in the DevTools Console in your browser. It will list the topics we learnt, and will also assign you a topic to revise.
